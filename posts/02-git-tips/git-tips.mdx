### Interactive committing: 

`git add -p`

Asks before adds to staging area. 


### Untracked files and stash 

`git stash --include-untracked`

By default the  [stash](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-stash)  command will not include untracked files.
To include untracked files, use the -u (—include-untracked) flag:

`git stash -u`

If the *—include-untracked* option is used, all untracked files are also stashed and then cleaned up with git clean, leaving the working directory in a very clean state.

### Applying stashed files (other than latest)

`git stash apply n`: applying anything other than latest stashed work. 

Start a branch from a stash: 
`git stash branch <optional branch name>`

Stash with name: 
`git stash save "Some name"`

### Cleaning’s stashes 
`git stash clear` or `git stash pop` to use latest, or `git stash drop` to remove latest. 

### See all stashes: 
`git stash list`

### RERERE

Git can record our resolutions, and keep reusing it to save us time rebasing. 

`git config rerere.enabled true`
Or 

`git config —global rerere.enabled true`

To turn off: 

`git config —global rerere.enabled false`


### Checkout to the latest branch you were on 

`git checkout -`

### Viewing stages changes: 

`git diff --staged`

### Follow a file 

`git log —name-status —follow —oneline hello.template`
